# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The root `README.md` serves as the tutorial front page with the learning path and update log. Narrative content lives in chapter markdown files named `chapterXX_*.md`, one per lesson. Interactive assets are in `examples/`, grouped by chapter (`examples/chapter0X/<sample>/`). Each sample contains an `index.html`, a `sketch.js` with the annotated p5.js logic, and optional assets such as images or CSS. Keep new materials aligned with this layout so learners can quickly map prose to runnable code.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
This repository is static; no build step is required. During authoring, launch a lightweight server from the project root to avoid browser security restrictions: `python3 -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000/examples/<chapter>/<sample>/`. Edit `sketch.js` or the associated markdown directly and refresh the browser to validate changes.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
p5.js sketches follow two-space indentation with readable vertical spacing between logical blocks. Prefer `camelCase` for variables and functions, mirroring the p5.js API. Keep filenames descriptive and lowercase with underscores (e.g., `basic_shapes`). Inline comments should clarify intent or parameters, matching the instructional tone already present in existing samples.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no automated test harness. Verify changes by opening the affected sample in a modern browser and confirming that interactions, animations, and explanatory comments still align with the chapter text. When adding new samples, ensure they render at 400Ã—400 by default unless the lesson requires otherwise, and document any deviations in both the markdown chapter and the sample folder's `README` if created.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Commit messages mirror the current history: start with an imperative verb, capitalize the first word, and keep them concise (e.g., "Add runnable examples for each tutorial sample"). For pull requests, provide a short summary of the learner-facing impact, list touched chapters or samples, and include screenshots or GIFs when visual changes are substantial. Flag any manual verification steps so reviewers can reproduce them quickly.
